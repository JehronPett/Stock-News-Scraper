# Stock-News-Scraper
This is a program I developed in Python that helps my day trading strategy. As I don't have much time while at school to stare at charts all day, I've converted my strategy to strictly buying stocks on good news. So I wrote these small program. It reads a news feed from Investors Hub and outputs the headlines of stocks that meet my criteria (under $10). With this program I am able to have a starting point to research as oppposed to looking at a news feed with thousands of articles that I would have to filter through. My ultimate goal for this program is to have it run during market hours and send me a notification (email, text, whatever) when news is released on a stock that's under $10.
